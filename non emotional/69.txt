"Net Run Rate" (NRR) is a statistical tie-breaking criterion used in limited-overs tournaments to differentiate teams with equal points.
It is calculated by subtracting the average runs per over conceded from the average runs per over scored by a team. 
A higher NRR indicates a more dominant performance.
