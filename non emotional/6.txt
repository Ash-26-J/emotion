One Day Internationals (ODIs) are limited to 50 overs per team, providing a faster-paced alternative to Test cricket. 
The format was accidentally created in 1971 when a Test match was rained out, leading to an impromptu one-day contest. 
ODIs balance strategic play with dynamic scoring opportunities.
