A "declaration" in Test cricket is a strategic decision by the captain of the batting team to voluntarily end their innings before all ten wickets have fallen. 
This is typically done when a team believes they have enough runs to win and need sufficient time to bowl out the opposition. 
Declarations are made to force a result in the match.
