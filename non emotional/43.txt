A "pinch-hitter" is a batsman, often from the lower order, promoted up the batting lineup in limited-overs cricket to score quick runs early in the innings. 
Their role is to aggressively attack the bowling and maximize scoring opportunities, even at the risk of dismissal. 
This tactic aims for a rapid acceleration of the score.
