"Powerplay" refers to specific periods within limited-overs cricket innings where fielding restrictions are imposed. 
During these overs, only a limited number of fielders are allowed outside the inner fielding circle, encouraging aggressive batting. 
This creates opportunities for quick scoring at the start and end of an innings.
