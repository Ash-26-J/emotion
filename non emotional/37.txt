Fast bowling focuses on delivering the ball at high speeds, often exceeding 140 km/h.
Fast bowlers aim to exploit pace, bounce, and movement in the air or off the pitch. 
Variations include swing bowling, where the ball curves in the air, and seam bowling, where it deviates after hitting the pitch.
