Cricket terminology includes a rich lexicon of unique terms and phrases that describe specific deliveries, shots, and events.
Examples include a "googly" (a deceptive leg-spin delivery), a "yorker" (a ball bowled to pitch at the batsman's feet), and being "out for a duck" (dismissed without scoring).
Understanding these terms is fundamental to comprehending the game.
