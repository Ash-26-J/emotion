A "stumped" dismissal is executed by the wicket-keeper when the batsman is out of their ground and not attempting a run, and the wicket-keeper dislodges the bails with the ball. 
This often happens when a batsman steps forward against a spin bowler and misses the ball.
It highlights the wicket-keeper's agility.
