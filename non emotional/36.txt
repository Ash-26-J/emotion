Spin bowling involves a bowler imparting significant rotation on the ball, causing it to deviate sharply after pitching.
Off-spin, which turns away from a right-handed batsman, and leg-spin, which turns into them, are the two main types.
Spinners rely on subtle variations and flight to deceive batsmen.
