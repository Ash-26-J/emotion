"Leg Before Wicket" (LBW) is a dismissal given when the ball would have gone on to hit the stumps but was intercepted by the batsman's leg or body. 
Specific criteria regarding pitching, impact, and trajectory must be met for an umpire to give an LBW decision.
It often involves complex judgments by the umpire.
