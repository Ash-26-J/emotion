A "Super Over" is a tie-breaking method used in limited-overs matches (especially T20s) when the scores of both teams are tied at the end of the regular innings.
Each team bats for one additional over, and the team scoring more runs in that over is declared the winner. 
It provides a thrilling conclusion to tied games.
