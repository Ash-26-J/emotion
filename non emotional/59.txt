A "king pair" is an even rarer and more ignominious batting achievement, occurring when a batsman is dismissed for a duck (no runs) on the first ball they face in both innings of a two-innings match, typically a Test match. 
This signifies a complete failure to score in either innings.
It's a very unwelcome distinction for a batsman.
