The "crease" is a series of lines marked on the pitch that define specific areas for batsmen and bowlers. 
The "popping crease" marks the safe ground for batsmen, while the "bowling crease" indicates where the bowler must release the ball. 
These lines are critical for judging legal deliveries and dismissals.
