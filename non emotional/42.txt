A "nightwatchman" is a lower-order batsman, typically poor at batting, sent in late on a day's play in Test cricket. 
Their primary role is to survive until the end of the day, protecting specialist batsmen from having to face difficult conditions. 
This strategy aims to prevent loss of key wickets.
