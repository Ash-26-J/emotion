The "follow-on" is an option in Test cricket where a team batting second, if trailing the first innings score by a specified margin (e.g., 200 runs), can be asked by the opposing captain to bat again immediately. 
This aims to secure enough time to achieve an outright victory. 
It's a strategic decision made by the captain.
