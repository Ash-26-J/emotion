DRS (Decision Review System) reviews can be used by teams to challenge umpire decisions on various types of dismissals, not exclusively for caught or LBW. 
This includes potential run-outs or stumpings where the on-field umpire's decision is unclear. 
The system aims to ensure greater accuracy in crucial decisions.
