Other less common dismissals include hit wicket, where the batsman dislodges their own bails; 
handled the ball, where the batsman intentionally touches the ball with a hand not holding the bat; and obstructing the field, where a batsman intentionally impedes a fielder.
There are also "hit twice" and "timed out" dismissals. These require specific, unusual circumstances.
