A "no-ball" is an illegal delivery bowled by the bowler, resulting in an extra run for the batting side.
Common reasons include overstepping the popping crease or bowling the ball too high. 
In limited-overs cricket, a no-ball often leads to a "free hit" on the subsequent delivery, where the batsman cannot be dismissed except by run-out.
